A large-scale agent-based simulation model of a securities exchange.

## API documentation

The API documentation for the model is very much a work in progress. To view the most current version of the documentation simply run the `sbt doc` command from the project root directory:

    $ sbt doc
    
The above command generates the documentation and places it under the `target` directory. The root file for the documentation is located at `target/scala-2.11/api/index.html`. To view the documentation, simply open this file in your favorite browser.
